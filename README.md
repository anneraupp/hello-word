Hello there, fellow visitor!

I am an architect and I know a total of zero things about architecture (just kidding), but I am curious and i've learned quite a lot more about programming (that's actually true!). 

I know a little bit of HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and Java. And I'm entering now the wonderful world of Python. 

I'm soon to be a Data Scientist!
Wish me luck!
